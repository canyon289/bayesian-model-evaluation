    "\n",
    "This section is quite heavy of math. However it is not critical to understand the fine details, but more so the path of thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Information Entropy*: Quantifying Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather is uncertain, and dice rolls are uncertain. But weather in certain areas is delightfully consistent, like my hometown of Orange County, and \"loaded dice\" are designed to be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Entropy is a summarization of our uncertainty through the following formula  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H_p(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{N} p(x_j)\\log(p(x_{j}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For some intuition, this is the minimum number of yes/no questions you need to determine $\\mathbf{x} = \\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1.** if it is sunny every day in Orange County, and I have a collection of 365 observations of whether it is sunny in Orange County, you already know $\\mathbf{p} = \\{1, 1, \\ldots, 1\\}$. To confirm with the formula that $H(\\mathbf{p}) = 0$, notice that $p(\\text{sunny}) = 1$, so $\\log(p(\\text{sunny})) = 0$, and we just have a sum of $0 \\cdot 1$, which is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2.** If we have a fair coin, and $N$ flips, then intuitively, I will have to go through and ask whether each flip was a head or a tail to determine the exact results, so we expect the entropy to be $N$. To confirm, notice that $p(\\text{heads}) = p(\\text{tails}) = 0.5$. By convention, we use base 2 logarithms, so \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log(p(\\text{heads}) = \\log(p(\\text{tails}) = \\log_2(0.5) = -1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the entropy is $H(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\sum_{j=1}^N -1 = N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Divergence*: Quantifying additional uncertainty added from estimations of the truth\n",
    "Now that we can quantify the uncertainty in the distribution of reality, we can compare the uncertainty in the distribution our model to see how far off we are. The formula is as follows, where $p$ is the truth and $q$ is the estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "$$KL_{p, q}(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\sum_{j=1}^{N} p(x_{j})(\\log(q(x_{j})) - \\log(p(x_{j}))) = H_p(\\mathbf{x}) - \\sum p(x_j)\\log(q(x_j))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the idea of **divergence**, a measurement of the \"distance\" between two distributions. One important note this distance is not symmetric. For some quick intuition It was way more surprising for me to go from always sunny Los Angeles and experience snow in Wisconsin, than it is for a native Wisconsite to see sun in Los Angeles. People in Los Angeles only see sun, people in Wisconsin see sun and snow, therefore a Los Angeles is much farther removed from the reality of a mixed sunny/snowy climate, than a Wisconsinite is to an always sunny climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Deviance*: Estimating additional uncertainty because we don't know the truth using deviance\n",
    "If we knew the truth then there wouldn't be anything to do. Since we don't know the truth this unfortunately means we can't use the formula above, but through some clever thinking it turns out you don't need to know the truth to compare two models, just how far off one model is relative from another. By using true data (The weather in the past), and a model estimates, its possible to calculate **deviance** which is an estimate of the divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken from Osvaldo Martin's book [Bayesian Data Analysis in Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/bayesian-analysis-python-second-edition)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_{kl}(p \\mid \\mid q) - D_{kl}(q \\mid \\mid r) \\approx \\sum_{n=1}^{N} log(q_{i}) - \\sum_{n=1}^{N} log(r_{i})$$\n",
    "Remember this works because we're not trying to see how far one model is from the truth, we're just trying to see how far two models are from the truth *relative to each other*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Information Criterion*: Making sure we're not overfitting to observed data using complex models\n",
    "Deviance uses data that has been observed to make an estimation. As it turns out it's impossible to use data you haven't seen because you haven't seen it. As it also turns out if you make models complex you can explain anything perfectly. *Information Criterion* uses both estimates of deviance and a penalizing for excess model complexity to \"score\" a model fit.\n"
